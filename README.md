Linux Loadable Kernel modules made with love
=======================

Hi! I see you happen to have stumbled upon my wonderful LKM playground. Here are a couple of LKM's that do some cool stuff. Right now I only made a helloworld lkm module and a systemhook-intercepting module. The software in references is stuff I didnt write, but I figured I would include it incase someone wanted to see some well commented code. Anyway, look around, its pretty neat.
